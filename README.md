# Africalancer-connecting african talent with opportunities
![header](/images/header.png)
> The pandemic exposed that Africa's lack of digital work infrastructure has the potential to disrupt the way work was actually working.  We need to creates digital spaces to network and create projects outside the conventional four cournes of the offices/classroom.   The lack of digital work infrastructure has led to scenarios where talent is  equally distributed however, opportunity  is not. At Africalancer, we hope to change this narrative by creating  leveled plaform for talent to connect with opportunity.

## General Information

Today, more than 60% of Africaâ€™s population is under the age of 25. By 2030, young Africans are expected to constitute 42% of global youth.  This is a great work force  that  can propel  the future of the continent forward if only we can  create  networking opportunities  for our youth to grow their skills.  In Africa, we dont have infrastructure to supporyt the connectintu of talent and opportunity that is awesome. 

Africalancer comes in  to provide infrastructure to connect talent and opportunity to catalayze Africa's economic prosperity.  Our UX/UI from the very start takes into account the local digital literacy among our prospective users.  Additionally,  we enable our users to create wages which enables them to create fair deals that would otherwise be hard in realife. We also create  a space for  business owners to access  diverse talent for their jobs. 


To this end, it is clear that Airlancer gains pride in leading the race to  provide infrastructure for Africa's digital economy.
